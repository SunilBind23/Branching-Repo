In your work experience what approach you follow to test the api

 1. Understanding API Requirements:   
 First, I analyze API documentation (like Swagger or Postman collections) to understand the endpoints, request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), input parameters, authentication types, and expected responses. I ensure clarity on the business logic behind each API.

 2. Manual API Testing with Postman:
 I start by testing each endpoint manually in Postman to validate:  
  Status Codes: Checking for 200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 based on scenarios.  
  Response Payload:  Verifying response data structure (JSON/XML) and correctness.  
  Headers & Authentication:  Testing headers like 'Content-Type', and authentication methods such as Bearer Tokens or Basic Auth.  
  Negative Testing:  Sending invalid inputs to check error handling and security responses.  
  Boundary Testing:  Testing with maximum and minimum data values.

 3. Automation of API Testing with RestAssured:   
 After successful manual testing, I automate test cases using  RestAssured  with  TestNG  for structured test execution.  
My automation approach includes:  
Writing  data-driven tests  for multiple input scenarios.  
Validating  response time  for performance checks.  
Asserting  response body fields , status codes, and headers using RestAssured matchers.  
 Generating  extent reports  for better visibility on test results.

 4. Functional and Security Testing:   
 Functional Checks:  Ensuring the API performs its intended function across all expected inputs.  



 5. Regression Testing & Continuous Integration:   
 After any code deployment or bug fix, I run a  regression suite  of automated API tests.  
These are integrated with  Jenkins , ensuring tests are triggered automatically on every build.

6. Reporting & Documentation:   
For manual tests, I log results in  JIRA  and update test cases accordingly.  
For automated runs,  Jenkins  provides build reports, and I also generate detailed  extent reports  for stakeholders.
